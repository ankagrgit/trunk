CLOG's source code has now moved to Github at https://github.com/adrianfish/clog.
Documentation will be maintained, as now, at https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/CLOG, but issues will
be maintained in Github.

This copy of CLOG's code will remain in Sakai SVN for the time being, but will not be updated.
